    As a developer
    Given a pitch
    I want to be able to add a functional interval to get another pitch.

FunctionalInterval
  - def above(pitch) -> pitch
FunctionalInterval
  - def below(pitch) -> pitch

Pitch addition and subtraction
  - define `Pitch#+`, `Pitch#-`
  - use FunctionalInterval methods
